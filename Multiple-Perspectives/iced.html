        <p>Like most goods under capitalism, tea is something that's mass produced and mass consumed. It's very common to see iced or canned teas in grocery stores. Since tea is so mass produced, people become more disconnected from the process of brewing and making tea. Whereas tea used to more commonly have a designated time for consumption, now it's something you can just pick up and drink while you do other things. It's less of an object for relaxation now than it is a vessel to help us produce more.</p>
