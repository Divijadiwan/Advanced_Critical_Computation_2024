        <p>Brewing tea is a skill in itself. It's very easy to make a tea that is too bitter, especially so in the case of green tea. Some tricks to making better tea is not using water that's too hot, and steeping for a 2-3 minutes. Taste in tea and brewing methods differ from person to person, so it's often a process of experimentation and finding what you like. It also helps to add things (ex. ginger or honey) if you don't like the taste of plain tea. Most people who think tea is "hot leaf juice" likely just haven't had tea that's brewed properly.</p>
