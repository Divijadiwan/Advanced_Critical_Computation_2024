        <p>Many Americans associate tea with the British, but the British only began drinking tea around the 1650s, as imports from China. This tea, earl grey, has a few different speculated origins. One of the more popular origins claims that a Chinese mandarin made the blend, which is black tea flavored with bergamot, as a gift for Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, the British Prime Minister of the 1830s. Regardless of how the blend actually game to be, it's clear it was based on Chinese black tea. </p>
